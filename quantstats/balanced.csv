"Tactical asset allocation model results from 01/01/2008 to 12/24/2020 are based on adaptive allocation model holding the top 3 best performing assets."
"The model uses a single performance window of 1 calendar month(s)."
"Volatility based risk adjustments are done based on daily volatility over the past 21 trading days."
"Risk parity weights based on the volatility window are used to set asset weights for each lookback period."
"Tactical asset allocation model trades are executed using the end of month close price each month based on the end of month signals."
